# Data Manipulation

## Array Methods
* map: Creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
* reduce: Executes a reducer function (provided by the user) on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.
* filter: Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

## JavaScript Data Structures
* WeakMap: A collection of key/value pairs in which the keys are objects and the values can be arbitrary values. The keys are held weakly, which means they can be garbage collected if there is no other reference to them.
* Set: A collection of unique values that can be iterated upon and used with various methods, such as has and add.

## Other Concepts
* Exporting and importing variables and functions in JavaScript using the export and import keywords.
* Throwing errors using the throw keyword and catching them using a try...catch block.
